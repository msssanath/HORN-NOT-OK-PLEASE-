# HORN-NOT-OK-PLEASE
A Mechanism for controlling noise pollution during traffic jams.

CURBING NOISE POLLUTION USING IoT. 
Indians have a very bad habit of honking unnecessarily.The project aims to cut down on the noise generated by unnecessary honking,thereby reducing noise pollution.Our system will sit inside a vehicle.It will measure the sound on the roads,and if the already existing sound level is above a specific level of decibels(dB) it will limit the level of sound generated by the vehicle(so that it doesn't add to the noise). This will try to solve a real world problem using IoT and thereby bringing a practical application of our project.
